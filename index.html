    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a software engineer who came up through health informatics research. I spent several years at
      MedStar Health's National Center for Human Factors in Healthcare studying how clinicians interact
      with EHR systems, building data pipelines, and publishing work on patient safety and clinical workflow.
      That work led to a U.S. patent and around 15 journal publications.
    </p>
    <p>
      These days I build production systems — cloud infrastructure on AWS, full-stack applications in
      TypeScript, and CI/CD pipelines that actually work. I like solving real problems with clean, maintainable
      code and figuring out how things fit together end to end.
